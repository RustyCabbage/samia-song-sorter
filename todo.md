(pretend there's a question mark at the end of all of these)

#### todo

##### eventually:tm:
- Import song lists?
	- Could I do this with a spotify link (album or playlist)? that would be cool.

##### maybe someday
- Show decision history during sorting
	- shows in the console idk if it's something worth doing
- Import decision history mid sort
	- probably have to store shuffle seed when exporting
- back/undo button
	- not easily possible with current implementation since going back merge levels breaks everything
- restart button mid sort
	- probably have to store shuffle seed
	- lazy implementation to take you to the list selection interface is very simple, but I don't see how it's much better than just refreshing the page

##### probably never
- tie buttons

- Use Atkinson Hyperlegible instead of Arial
	- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible
	- I don't like the way it looks ._.

#### other ideas
- autogenerated button colors:
	- take album art
	- get rgb values of every pixel
	- iteratively k-means cluster, starting with k=2
		if max(euclidean distance of the last cluster to all other clusters < some_value), stop, else k++
	- take the largest cluster (the one containing the most pixels), use this as a base
	- convert to HSV and mess around with the values until you have 5
