(pretend there's a question mark at the end of all of these)

- To shuffle or not to shuffle
	- Make this an option?
- Import/Export decision history
- Show decision history during sorting
	- maybe make this toggleable
- Use Atkinson Hyperlegible instead of Arial
	- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible
	- I don't like the way it looks ._.
	
- Import song lists?
	- Could I do this with a spotify link (album or playlist)? that would be cool.
